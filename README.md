# Mod Compat Utilities

This library is filled with Python packages that are useful in order to get you up and running with inter-mod compatability within a Vanilla datapack. The datapack you produce using the files output (into `./out/**/*.json`) can be loaded into every world you play using the [Global Resource and Datapacks Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drp-global-datapack).

## Setup

Setup for this is pretty straight forward.

1. Install Python for your current OS: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download this repo by clicking the Green "Clone" button above and choosing `Download Zip`
3. Run the Shell/Batch file (Batch for Windows, Shell for Linux/MacOS/WSL/Other) that corresponds to the data you wish to create (i.e. if I was on Windows wanting to create a set of recipes to turn 2 slabs into their solid-block counterpart, I'd run `./scripts/batch/slabs.bat` by double-clicking it.)
